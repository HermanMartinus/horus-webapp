<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Passwords suck. Passphrases are much better for many reasons niftily explained by <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/" target="_blank">this XKCD comic</a>.
  If you're not convinced, here's <a href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/936:_Password_Strength" target="_blank">a more in-depth explanation</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Cool password manager doesn't store passwords, it generates them on the fly by doing a one-way hash of your super secret master password, combined with the name of the service you're trying to access, then generating a 4 word passphrase from the result. You can then set your service's password to the generated passphrase, and whenever the need to login comes, you can regenerate your password.
</p>
<p>
  Here's how the algorithm works:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
  combo = master_password + service_name
  // combo -> 'this is my master password facebook'

  digit_array = hash(combo).split
  // digit_array -> '["1264", "0031", "2010", "0795"]'

  generated_passphrase = wordlist[digit_array[0]]
                        +  wordlist[digit_array[1]] 
                        +  wordlist[digit_array[2]] 
                        +  wordlist[digit_array[3]]
  // generated_passphrase -> 'churn about crucial indicate'
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  In this way, no passwords are ever stored, and the only password you need to remember is your master passphrase, as it is the seed to generating all of your passwords.
</p>
<p>For those interested, the wordlist is has 2048 words, resulting in a password with 44 bits of entropy.</p>
